    """Creating the optimal shortest path tree from node 0 to all remaining arcs for a given number
    of nodes (n) and arcs (m).

    At first it may seem superfluous that the optimal tree requires 'm' as an input, as a tree is 
    known to have exactly n-1 arcs. However given that the final graph must also contain a loop containing all of
    the nodes, for small values of m (explicitly m < 2n-1), some care must be taken when building the optimal tree to ensure that
    there are sufficient arcs remaining to build a loop.

    To address this, we first calculate the minimum number of arcs of the optimal tree that are also arcs in 
    the loop, (not including arc (n-1)->(0)). We will refer to these arcs as 'loop arcs'. We sample the
    required number of loop arcs by selecting predecessors from the range 0..(n-2). Note that the loop arcs are
    not yet added to the tree.

    To build the tree we use the following properties. For any tree with at least two nodes,
    - the root node has at least one child
    - all other nodes have exactly one parent.
