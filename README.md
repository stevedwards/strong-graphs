Generate the following ðŸ’ª graphs with this command
``` #python 
python3 generate.py 20
```

### Complexity
The intended complexity of the generator is O(n + m). Currently I have O(n log n + m) I believe, with the log n coming from having to order the nodes by distance in order to add negative arc weights in a control way.
